# Project Description
Posted at https://github.com/odtu/ee463/tree/master/Hardware-Project

Three possible topologies are allowed:
- Single-phase diode rectifier + buck converter
- Single-phase thyristor rectifier (SCR)
- Three-phase thyristor rectifier (SCR)

Do we want to attempt any of the bonuses?

# Project Deadlines
- **28 October:** AC/DC Converter Part Simulation Report and Hardware Demo
- **25 November:** Complete Simulation Report
- **23 December:** Hardware Demo
- **9 January:** Final Report
- **23 January:** Video - 23th of January


# Outline of Project Plan
- [ ] Select the topology that we want to work on.  
  GOAL: Reduce the future work needed in the project by narrowing down design choices early. If it doesn't work
  we can revisit the topology selection as the project progresses.

- [ ] Model the three prospective topologies generally.   
  GOAL: Experience with modeling software & blocks
 
- [ ] Model the three prospective topologies with project-specific load characteristics but general switch models.  
  GOAL: Begin to see some switch ratings needed for different topologies.
  
- [ ] Research commercially available switching devices with adequate ratings.  
  GOAL: Look at size / packaging, efficiency, cost, driver needs to narrow down component(s) to evaluate in detail.

- [ ] Model in detail prospective major components such as switching devices, diodes, capacitors, and inductors.  
  GOAL: Validate if prospective devices are suitable.
  
- [ ] Research & model control & switch driver devices.


- [ ] Procure major & accessory components including circuit protection, heat sink, connectors, enclosure,
  wire, prototyping materials.

- [ ] Prototype & test  --> Iterate back to design & modeling as needed.

- [ ] Package final design nicely (as nicely as we want, but at least nicely enough not to break before the
  final testing.


# Log of project procurement
Keep a list of what components are purchased, where from, and a what price. We will probably buy more than
we need for the final version, but the final bill of material (BOM) will be a subset of this.
- Example: *Item x* from *Supplier A* at 00 TL.
