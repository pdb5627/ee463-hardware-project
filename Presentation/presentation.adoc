== Option 1: Three-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)

[cols="2*a", options="header"]
|===
|Advantages|Disadvantages
|
- Higher average output voltage attainable
- Less ripple compared to single-phase rectifier
|
- Requires firing circuits for six thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage
|===

<<<
== Option 2: Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

<<<
== Option 2: Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

[cols="2*a", options="header"]
|===
|Advantages|Disadvantages
|
- Fast and accurate control of output is possible
|
- Requires capacitor & inductor
- Many components

== Option 3: Single-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)

[cols="2*a", options="header"]
|===
|Advantages|Disadvantages
|
- Fewer thyristors compared to three-phase (4 vs 6)
|
- Available output voltage is less compared to three-phase AC input
- Still requires firing circuits for four thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage

// Recommendation from prof to WhatsApp group - add screenshot?

[cols="2*a", options="header"]
|===
|Advantages|Disadvantages
|
- Circuit is very simple with few components
- Single control circuit needed
|
- Introduction of feedback control difficult to incorporate

== Key Component Ratings

Maximum component stress from simulation results

- Triac: V~max~ = 311 V, I~rms~ = 17.6 A

- Diode Bridge: V~max~ = 306 V, I~rms~ = 12.5 A (per diode)

- Resistors: All < 1/4 W. (But Littlefuse application note recommends 1/2 W for R~3~)

- Capacitors: < 60 V

<<<
== Project Plan

- Complete bill of material
- Procure components (https://direnc.net[Direnc.net] + Konya Sokak)
- Build prototype
- Test on increasing loads (load bank then motor)
- Troubleshoot & modify prototype as needed
- Once working prototype is obtained, as time allows
  * Consider modifications for feedback in firing circuit
  * Add remaining touches like enclosure, PCB, etc
