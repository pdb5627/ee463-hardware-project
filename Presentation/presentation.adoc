ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

[.two-col]
.Advantages
- Higher average output voltage attainable
- Less ripple compared to single-phase rectifier

.Disadvantages
- Requires firing circuits for six thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage

== Option 2: Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

[.two-col]
.Advantages
- Fast and accurate control of output is possible

.Disadvantages
- Requires capacitor & inductor
- Many components

== Option 3: Single-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)

ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

[.two-col]
.Advantages
- Fewer thyristors compared to three-phase (4 vs 6)

.Disadvantages
- Available output voltage is less compared to three-phase AC input
- Still requires firing circuits for four thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage


== Single-Phase Diac-Controlled Triac Rectifer

ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

[.two-col]
.Advantages
- Circuit is very simple with few components
- 

.Disadvantages
- Introduction of feedback control difficult to incorporate
