== Topology Options

. Three-phase thyristor rectifier (SCR) 
. Three-phase diode rectifier + buck converter
. Single-phase thyristor rectifier (SCR)
. Single-Phase Diac-Controlled Triac Rectifer


== Option 1: Three-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)

ifdef::backend-revealjs[== Option 1: Three-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)]

.Advantages
- Higher average output voltage attainable
- Less ripple compared to single-phase rectifier

.Disadvantages
- Requires firing circuits for six thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage

== Option 2: Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

ifdef::backend-revealjs[== Option 2: Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter]

.Advantages
- Fast and accurate control of output is possible

.Disadvantages
- Requires capacitor & inductor
- Many components

== Option 3: Single-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)

ifdef::backend-revealjs[== Option 3: Single-phase Thyristor Rectifier (SCR)]

.Advantages
- Fewer thyristors compared to three-phase (4 vs 6)

.Disadvantages
- Available output voltage is less compared to three-phase AC input
- Still requires firing circuits for four thyristors
- Firing control must be synchronized with input AC voltage


== Single-Phase Diac-Controlled Triac Rectifer

ifdef::backend-revealjs[== Single-Phase Diac-Controlled Triac Rectifer]

.Advantages
- Circuit is very simple with few components
- 

.Disadvantages
- Introduction of feedback control difficult to incorporate

== Key Component Ratings

Maximum component stress from simulation results

- Triac: V~max~ = 311 V, I~rms~ = 17.6 A

- Diode Bridge: V~max~ = 306 V, I~rms~ = 12.5 A (per diode)

- Resistors: All < 1/4 W. (But Littlefuse application note recommends 1/2 W for R~3~)

- Capacitors: < 60 V
